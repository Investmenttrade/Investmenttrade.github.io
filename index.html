Do you want to learn how to start investing and how to make money in the stock market? Then read on as I share with you the top 10 best investment ideas for beginners that can make you money both in the short and long run.</strong> </p> <p> If you are a beginner investor, the thought of parting with your money for investment options is quite hard; and even scary at times. But with the help of these top 10 investment ideas for beginners, the entire process of investing will get somewhat easier.</p> <p> So to help you figure out what to do in terms of investments, here are, in no particular order, the top 10 best investment ideas for beginners that can make you money.</p> <p> Before I proceed, I want to state clearly that each of these investment ideas has its own fundamental principles and strategies that you must know. Secondly, you don’t need to invest in all of them to achieve success; just pick one or two that you are willing to learn through and stick with it. Having noted these points, let’s proceed.</p> <h2> Top 10 Best Investment Ideas for Beginners that can Make You Money</h2> <strong> Real Estate</strong> <p> If you are looking for well-protected investments, then you should invest in real estate. Even in developing nations, the real estate sector thrives and flourishes thus making them excellent investments.</p> <strong> Gold</strong> <p> Whether in the form of jewelry or in bars, it is always a good idea to invest in gold. Unlike most of the other investment options, gold’s value is continually on the rise as the dollar keeps depreciating in value.</p> <strong> Forex</strong> <p> When compared to the other forms of investment, it is forex trading that yields the best returns; not to mention that you can start forex trading with a small capital. If you have a sound strategy, it is possible to make a tidy sum of money in forex trading.</p> <strong> Insurance</strong> <p> Everyone needs insurance so investing in a plan or two will make sure that you are well taken cared of in cases of emergency or when you grow old and retire.</p> <strong> Your company’s 401k</strong> <p> Lots of companies offer “ safe harbor ” or other similar retirement plans. The way safe harbor contribution programs work is that the entire amount paid by your company are vested to you entirely; this means that even if you choose to resign from your job, the funds will still be in your name.</p> <strong> Treasury Bonds</strong> <p> These are safe investments, mainly because it is the government that issues them. You can buy treasury bonds for as low as a thousand dollars each and they yield upwards of 5% after maturing.</p> <strong> Stock Market</strong> <p> If you like a bit of excitement while earning some money at the same time then you should try dabbling in the stock market. Just take note of the risks involved in trading stocks so that you do not lose too much money if your stock picks take a dive.</p> <strong> Mutual Funds</strong> <p> If you want a simpler way to invest then mutual funds is more up your alley. You only need to choose a particular type of fund and then direct them to your fund manager and he will do the rest.</p> <strong> Penny Stocks</strong> <p> If you are looking for an investment option that can possibly make you a lot of money in just hours, try trading penny stocks. These are volatile stocks that are so cheap that they can actually double or triple in value within a span of a couple of hours.</p> <strong> Time Deposits and Other Bank Products</strong> <p> You can always talk with a representative of your local bank and ask about their fixed deposit schemes. Most banks offer really generous returns on time deposits, certificate of deposits and the like, making them worthwhile investments.</p> Author Recent Posts Ajaero Tony Martins <span> Founder / Publisher</span> at <span> Profitable Venture Magazine Ltd</span> Ajaero Tony Martins is an Entrepreneur, Real Estate Developer and Investor; with a passion for sharing his knowledge with budding entrepreneurs.
